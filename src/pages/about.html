                            The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing
                            Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a
                            member of MDHL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside
                            neighborhood. MDHL ran by o small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time
                            of
                            parents and previous league members.
